  "readme": "# [Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TryGhost/Ghost.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TryGhost/Ghost)\r\n\r\nGhost is a free, open, simple blogging platform that's available to anyone who wants to use it. Lovingly created and maintained by [John O'Nolan](http://twitter.com/JohnONolan) + [Hannah Wolfe](http://twitter.com/ErisDS) + an amazing group of [contributors](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/contributors).\r\n\r\nVisit the project's website at <http://ghost.org> &bull; docs on <http://support.ghost.org>.\r\n\r\n## Getting Involved\r\n\r\nWant to report a bug, request a feature, contribute or translate Ghost? Check out our in-depth guide to [Contributing to Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). We need all the help we can get! You can also join in with our [community](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost#community) to keep up-to-date and meet other Ghosters.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nThere are a few different ways to install Ghost, take care to use the method which best suits your needs.\r\n\r\n**Please note** - the downloadable zip files we provide on [Ghost.org](http://ghost.org/download), the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/releases), and via npm are pre-built packages designed for getting setup quickly. Cloning from the git repository requires you to install several dependencies and build the assets yourself. \r\n\r\n### Install from zip (fastest & best for bloggers)\r\n\r\nIf you just want to get a Ghost blog running in the fastest time possible, this method is for you.\r\n\r\nFor detailed instructions for various platforms visit the [Ghost Installation Guide](http://support.ghost.org/installation/). If you get stuck, help is available on [our support site](http://support.ghost.org/).\r\n\r\n1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) - Ghost requires **Node v0.10.x**\r\n1. Download the latest Ghost package from [Ghost.org](http://ghost.org/download). \r\n1. Create a new directory where you would like to run the code, and un-zip the package to that location.\r\n1. Fire up a Terminal, the Node Command Prompt or shell and change directory to the root of the Ghost application (where config.example.js and index.js are)\r\n1. run `npm install --production` to install the node dependencies. If you see `error Error: ENOENT` on this step, make sure you are in the project directory and try again.\r\n1. To start ghost, run `npm start`\r\n1. Visit `http://localhost:2368/` in your web browser or go to `http://localhost:2368/ghost` to log in\r\n\r\nCheck out the [Documentation](http://support.ghost.org/) for more detailed instructions, or get in touch via the [forum](http://ghost.org/forum) if you get stuck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Install from git\r\n\r\nIf you're a developer or someone comfortable getting up and running from a `git clone`, this method is for you.\r\n\r\nIf you clone the GitHub repository, you will need to build a number of assets using grunt.\r\n\r\nPlease do **NOT** use the master branch of Ghost in production. If you are using git to deploy to production, please use the latest [release](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/releases) or the [stable](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/tree/stable) branch which contains the latest release.\r\n\r\n#### Quickstart:\r\n\r\n1. `npm install -g grunt-cli`\r\n1. `npm install`\r\n1. `grunt init` (and `grunt prod` if you want to run Ghost in production mode)\r\n1. `npm start`\r\n\r\nFull instructions & troubleshooting tips can be found in the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) under the heading \"[Working on Ghost Core](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#working-on-ghost-core)\".\r\n\r\nCheck out the [Documentation](http://support.ghost.org/) for more detailed instructions, or get in touch via the [forum](http://ghost.org/forum) if you get stuck.\r\n\r\n### Install from npm\r\n\r\nIf you want to build Ghost into a larger node app, or are familiar with using `npm` packages, then this method might be for you.\r\n\r\n`npm install ghost`\r\n\r\nFurther setup instructions can be found in the [using Ghost as a NPM module](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/wiki/Using-Ghost-as-an-NPM-module) wiki entry.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Upgrading to The Latest Version\r\n\r\nUpgrade instructions can be found on the [Ghost Support Site](http://support.ghost.org/how-to-upgrade/)\r\n\r\n### Logging in For The First Time\r\n\r\nOnce you have the Ghost server up and running, you should be able to navigate to `http://localhost:2368/ghost/` from a web browser, where you will be prompted to setup your blog and user account. Once you have entered your desired credentials you will be automatically logged in to the admin area. The setup screen will not be accessible once the process has been completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Community\r\n\r\nKeep track of Ghost development and Ghost community activity.\r\n\r\n* Follow Ghost on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/TryGhost), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ghost) and [Google+](https://plus.google.com/114465948129362706086).\r\n* Read and subscribe to the [Official Ghost Blog](http://blog.ghost.org) and the [Ghost Development Blog](http://dev.ghost.org).\r\n* Join in discussions on the [Ghost Forum](http://ghost.org/forum/)\r\n* Chat with Ghost developers on IRC. We're on `irc.freenode.net`, in the `#Ghost` channel. We have a public meeting every Tuesday at 5:30pm London time.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Versioning\r\n\r\nFor transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, Ghost will be maintained according to the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) guidelines as much as possible.\r\n\r\nReleases will be numbered with the following format:\r\n\r\n`<major>.<minor>.<patch>-<build>`\r\n\r\nConstructed with the following guidelines:\r\n\r\n* A new *major* release indicates a large change where backwards compatibility is broken.\r\n* A new *minor* release indicates a normal change that maintains backwards compatibility.\r\n* A new *patch* release indicates a bugfix or small change which does not affect compatibility.\r\n* A new *build* release indicates this is a pre-release of the version.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Copyright & License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013-2014 Ghost Foundation - Released under the [MIT license](LICENSE).\r\n",
